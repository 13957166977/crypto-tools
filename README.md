Some crypto tools that might help

* [find a coding/hash scheme](find-coding-scheme)
* [One Time Pad](otp)
* [Poem Code](poemcode)
* [Caesar Rot](rot)

This repo is a total mess, I will clean/organize it and improve the code, as soon as I got more time on my hands.

Also I've seen this <http://blogs.gnome.org/muelli/2012/05/breaking-multiple-time-pad/> and maybe it's cool?
This also looks promising: <http://cryptosmith.org/archives/70>
