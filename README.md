Some crypto tools that might help

* [find a coding/hash scheme](find-coding-scheme)
* [One Time Pad](otp)
* [Poem Code](poemcode)
* [Caesar Rot](rot)
* [Crackmd5](crackmd5)
* [Handycode](handycode)

This repo is a total mess, I will clean/organize it and improve the code, as soon as I got more time on my hands.
